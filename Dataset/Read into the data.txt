The data are stored in text files with each line formatted as follows:

1.0000,0.0000,1.0000
2.0000,-0.0000,0.0033

Details:

First number: Represents the label of the point (e.g., 1.0000 for spiral one, 2.0000 for spiral two). Only the integer part of this number is relevant for classification purposes.

Second number: Indicates the x-coordinate of the point.

Third number: Indicates the y-coordinate of the point.

Each coordinate pair (x, y) corresponds to a specific point in the dataset, classified according to the spiral label provided.
